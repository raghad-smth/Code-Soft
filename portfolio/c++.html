      <h1>AVL Tree Implementation for Item Management</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project implements an AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search
        tree, to efficiently manage and organize items based on their names and
        prices. The program demonstrates advanced features, including the
        ability to traverse items using multiple properties and ensuring the
        tree remains balanced after each operation.
      </p>
      <h2>Key Features</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Dynamic Insertion and Deletion: Efficiently add and remove items while
          maintaining the AVL Tree balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Multi-Property Traversal: Traverse and display items in ascending and
          descending order based on either name or price.
        </li>
        <li>
          Self-Balancing Mechanism: Automatic balancing through rotations to
          ensure optimal search, insertion, and deletion times.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technologies Used</h2>

      <ul></ul>
      <li>C++: Implementation of the AVL Tree and item management.</li>

      <li>
        Object-Oriented Design: Use of classes and methods to encapsulate the
        functionalities of items and the AVL Tree.
      </li>

      <h2>Functionalities of the Program:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Adding Nodes: The addNode method inserts new nodes into the tree while
          ensuring it remains balanced. This involves checking the balance
          factor and performing rotations if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deleting Nodes: The deleteNode method removes nodes from the tree,
          ensuring the tree remains balanced after each deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tree Traversal: Unlike a typical AVL tree that might traverse based on
          a single property, this implementation can traverse the items using
          multiple properties, specifically names and prices. This is achieved
          by implementing separate in-order and reverse in-order traversal
          methods for each property:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            By Name: Methods diplayOrderdByNameAsc() and
            diplayOrderdByNameDesc() display the items in ascending and
            descending order by name, respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            By Price: Methods diplayOrderdByPricAsc() and
            diplayOrderdByPricDesc() display the items in ascending and
            descending order by price, respectively.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Balancing: The program maintains the balance of the tree by
          calculating the height and balance factor of each node, performing
          necessary rotations to keep the tree height-balanced.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Implementation Details:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Item Class: Defines the properties and comparison operators for items,
          enabling sorting by name.
        </li>
        <li>
          AVL Tree Methods: Handles insertion and deletion while maintaining the
          treeâ€™s balance through rotations (left, right, left-right, and
          right-left).
        </li>
        <li>
          Traversal Methods: Separate traversal functions allow the tree to be
          displayed based on different properties (name and price).
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Files Included</h2>
      <p>
      AVL.h: Header file containing class declarations for Item, AVLNode, and
      AVLTree. AVL.cpp: Implementation file defining the methods for managing
      items and the AVL Tree operations. main.cpp: Example usage demonstrating
      the creation of items, adding them to the AVL Tree, and displaying the
      tree in different orders. Usage To run the project, compile the files
      together and execute the main program. The example in main.cpp shows how
      to create items, insert them into the tree, and display the tree's
      contents in various orders.

        Overall, this program showcases an efficient way to manage a collection
        of items using an AVL Tree, ensuring quick search, insertion, and
        deletion operations while maintaining balance. The unique capability of
        traversing items based on multiple properties adds flexibility and
        demonstrates advanced usage of AVL Trees.
